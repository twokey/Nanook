# H1 Nanook

Nanook makes choosing the destination for your next trip easy. It provides all the information you need to compare and choose the routes to different destination. The trip planner helps you quickly and conveniently compare airfare to as many destinations as you need. 
You can search and choose the destination of your trip as well as where you are traveling from. Nanook leverage Rome2rio API to download all available routes between the two cities of your choice. You can enter any town and Nanook instantly displays all available air routes between the destinations with estimated travel time and fares.
